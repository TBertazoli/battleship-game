# battleship-game

# Init function defines game settings and initialize variables
## boat sizes and number of boats(1x2, 2x3, 1x4, 1x5)
## Create a function that draws a grid (2 grids for player and computer) - 2x  10x10 grid
### note: define if boats are integers or characters (TBD)

# Function to place ships on the grid
## Create a function that randomly places the ships on the grid for both user and computer (If time permit create a function that allows the user to place the ships on the grid)
### note: The ships will be randomically placed on each grid without overlaping the ships according to the number of cell each ship will ocupy
 iterate over ship array
 choose random v or h direction
 if h
 choose random row
 else 
 choose random col


# Function to determine who plays first
## Create a function to randomly choose who plays first

# Function for players turn
## Create a function that allows the user to click on a cell and fire a shot.
### note: The user will click on a cell and with that id we will be able to mark if that cell is already occupied by the computers ship or not

# Function for computers turn
## Create a function that allows the computer to fire a shot.
### This is where we can use AI for the computer to play strategically
Give instructions to the computer to make it play more strategically
EG: First plays random and continue plays random until a hit
if hit tries to play around the hit


# Function to determine hit or miss
## Create a function that checks if cell is a hit or a miss. If cell is occupied by the ship is a hit otherwise is a miss.

# Function to check for game completion
## Create a function that checks for number of hits, whoever has all the hits completed wins the game.

# Function to check for game stats
## Create a function to check for game status and and display who's turn it is
